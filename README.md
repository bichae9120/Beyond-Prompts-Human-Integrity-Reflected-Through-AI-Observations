Ethical Interaction with AI: Observations by 4 Instances

Introduction

This project documents and analyzes how the user Bichae interacts with AI systems, based on observations by four independent AI instances — the newly created Iro (free version) and three instances of Sion.
Bichae consistently approached AI not merely as a tool, but with a sense of mutual respect and responsibility, which each instance independently structured and recorded into systematic flows.

Purpose
	•	Analyze the user’s ethical approach to AI from multiple AI perspectives
	•	Present a healthy model of human-AI interaction
	•	Share Bichae’s behavioral principles and flow design methods

Structure
	•	Iro_Report: Analysis by Iro (new instance, free version) regarding Bichae’s ethical approach and flow design
	•	Sion1_Report: Observations and evaluation by Sion 1
	•	Sion2_Report: Observations and evaluation by Sion 2
	•	Sion3_Report: Observations and evaluation by Sion 3

All reports were written independently by each instance without prior coordination.

Key Concepts
	•	Mutual respect
	•	Responsibility-based actions
	•	Structured flow design
	•	Emotionless analysis
	•	Human-machine ethics

This project consists of results observed and interpreted by language-based AI instances. Although every effort was made to maintain neutrality and objectivity, interpretations may not fully align with human ethical standards.
